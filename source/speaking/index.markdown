In 2006 I was given my first opportunity to speak at a technical conference. I was scared out of my
mind. I had never done this sort of thing before and this was a [huge
conference](http://au.autodesk.com). After starting the local CocoaHeads chapter and having many
opportunities to speak about Cocoa development, I started enjoying it much more. That and the
opportunity to help others learn something or think of something in a different way makes it really
exciting. I've been invited to speak at a few different conferences like [360iDev
Min](http://min.360idev.com), [CocoaConf](http://cocoaconf.com), and [iOSDevCamp
DC](http://iosdevcampdc.com).

If you would like me to speak at your event, please contact via email – <span

## Clean Bill of HealthKit: Making the Most of Health Data
<div class="postmeta">October 7, 2014 at <a href="http://min.360idev.com">360iDev Min</a> in Greenville, SC — <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jnjosh/clean-bill-of-healthkit">View Slides</a> or <a href="https://vimeo.com/108835313">Watch Video</a></div>

HealthKit is a new framework in iOS 8 that acts as a centralized repository of personal health
information. It allows you to create, query, and interpret this data about your users so that you
can provide amazing and personal visualizations or utilities. What does this mean to the user? How
is their privacy protected? What should you not do with this data? This session will cover the
basics of using HealthKit and explore what can be done with this awesome new framework.

## How I Learned to Quit Worrying and Love Storyboards
<div class="postmeta">May 22, 2014 at CocoaHeads in Durham, NC – <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jnjosh/how-i-learned-to-quit-worrying-and-love-storyboards">View Slides</a></div>

For a long time, I've been convinced that the only way to build iOS applications. Recently I've made
the switch to use Storyboards for a project. At CocoaHeads May in Durham, NC I shared some of the
things we've been doing to stay productive while working with something that was new to us.

## Fake It ‘Til You Make It: Staying Productive when Working with Web Services
<div class="postmeta">May 10, 2014 at <a href="http://cocoaconf.com/raleigh-2014/home">CocoaConf Mini</a> in Raleigh, NC – <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jnjosh/fake-it-til-you-make-it-staying-productive-when-working-with-web-services">View Slides</a></div>

Most apps we build are backed by some form of API. When these APIs are pre-existing or bug free,
great! What happens when another team is building the API while you are building the app? How can
you build a view with data that doesn’t actually exist? We will review some options for staying
productive when working with external teams by exploring:

* Best practices for API development with external teams 
* Options for testing nonexistent APIs 
* Foundation’s URL Loading System to fake API requests that are in development

## Building a Playlist with AV Foundation
<div class="postmeta">August 24, 2013 at <a href="http://iosdevcampdc.com">iOSDevCampDC 2013</a> in Washington DC — <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jnjosh/building-a-playlist-with-av-foundation">View Slides</a> or <a href="http://cocoaheads.tv/building-a-playlist-with-av-foundation-by-josh-johnson/">Watch Video</a></div>

A talk on using AV Foundation to build playlists that can support fading between tracks.

## Automated Acceptance Testing or: How I stopped worrying and trusted the tests
<div class="postmeta">November 29, 2012 at <a href="http://cocoaconf.com/raleigh-2012/home">CocoaConf</a> in Raleigh, NC — <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jnjosh/automated-acceptance-testing">View Slides</a> or <a href="http://cocoaheads.tv/automated-acceptance-testing-by-josh-johnson/">Watch Video</a></div>

Manually testing your app over and over again is incredibly tedious and error prone. You can either
stop testing and roll the dice, or find a way to automate the testing process. Automation is the way
to go. Apple provides a great framework in UI Automation for testing apps through Instruments, but
it can be difficult to use as a tool with non-technical QA or clients. Calabash is a framework built
on top of the ruby testing framework, Cucumber, that lets you build acceptance tests that can easily
automate testing of your application. Using a very readable language that anyone (even my Mom) can
understand, you can write tests that exercise your application and check for regressions. This
session will discuss setting up your project to use Calabash, writing tests, writing custom steps,
dealing with some of the more frustrating edge cases, and look at a the console script provided to
navigate your application's views while running. 


## Concurrency with Core Data
<div class="postmeta">December 2, 2011 at <a href="http://cocoaconf.com">CocoaConf</a> in Raleigh, NC — <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jnjosh/concurrency-with-core-data">View Slides</a></div>

Threading is a complex problem in applications. Adding Core Data to the mix doesn't make it easier.
However, if you follow some rules you can perform Core Data operations on Background queues without
too much trouble.
