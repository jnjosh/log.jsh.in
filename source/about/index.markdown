## About Me

Hi, I'm Josh Johnson. I'm a software developer, wannabe designer, filmmaker, and podcaster living in Raleigh, NC with my wife, my two teenagers (!), a comfort retriever named Ruby, and two cats. I've been developing software since I was about 10 when my Dad gave me a Macintosh Plus with some form of BASIC. I still have that Macintosh to this day; and it works.

My passion is writing software for Mac and iOS. For years I wrote software for Windows and the Web, but when the iPhone was introduced in 2007 I dusted off my old 12" PowerBook and started learning Cocoa. This lead to my current position as a Senior iOS Developer with [Two Toasters](http://twotoasters.com/) in Durham where I help create insanely great apps for iOS everyday. I'm also organizer of [Triangle CocoaHeads and NSCoder Nights](http://trianglecocoa.com/).

When not writing code or with my family, you can [find me podcasting about B-movies so bad that they are enjoyable](http://badmoviepodcast.com/) or [dreaming up movie ideas](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2522715/).

## About this Blog

This is a personal blog. Most of the time it will be about Cocoa-related topics, but I usually have a lot of different interests that could find a way here. Lately, a lot of other Mac and iPhone Developers have taken their thoughts back to their blogs. Why not play along?

Technically, this blog is a baked blog. It is written in pure HTML/CSS/Javascript with the help of the [Octopress](http://octopress.org). The '@' symbol comes from [Pictos](http://pictos.drewwilson.com/).
