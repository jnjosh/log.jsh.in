Hi, I'm Josh Johnson. I'm a software developer, wannabe designer, filmmaker, and podcaster living in
Raleigh, NC with my wife, my two teenagers (!), a comfort retriever named Ruby, and two cats. I've
been developing software since I was about 10 when my Dad gave me a Macintosh Plus with some form of
BASIC. I still have that Macintosh to this day; and it works.

My passion is writing software for Mac and iOS. For years I wrote software for Windows and the Web,
but when the iPhone was introduced in 2007 I dusted off my old 12" PowerBook and started learning
Cocoa. This lead to my current position as the Director of Development with [Two
Toasters](http://twotoasters.com/) in Durham where I help create insanely great apps. I'm also
organizer of [Triangle CocoaHeads and NSCoder Nights](http://trianglecocoa.com/) and occasionally
[speak at conferences about Cocoa development](https://speakerdeck.com/jnjosh).

## About this Blog

This is a personal blog. Most of the time it will be about Cocoa-related topics, but I usually have
a lot of different interests that could find a way here. It is written in HTML/CSS/Javascript with
the help of the [Octopress](http://octopress.org).
