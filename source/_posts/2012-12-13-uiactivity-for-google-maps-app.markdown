At our October [CocoaHeads](http://meetup.trianglecocoa.com) I gave a small talk on using UIActivity to create nice little wrappers around your application's URL Schemes. I wanted to look for an app to implement a quick version of this on, but got busy and forgot.

Tonight, Google released the [Google Maps App for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id585027354?mt=8) and [matching documentation for their URL Scheme](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios/urlscheme). I thought it was worth trying to wrap it in a UIActivity. It is far from tested or complete, but it was a fun little project to hack on.
