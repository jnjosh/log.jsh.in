_A few months ago I spent a weekend and built a small app for the show my friend and I do every week, [The Bad Movie Podcast](http://badmoviepodcast.com). Then I sat on it for several months, only tweaking it occasionally. Deep down I thought there was no way Apple would approve it due to the nature of the show. Thankfully, a few people informed me that I was silly and should "Roll the Dice"._

So I rolled the dice and I'm glad I did. The app is now approved and will be live on the store tomorrow morning. It is a really simple app which allows you to listen to the show easily.

I'm really excited, because this will be the first time since 2008 that I've released an app for myself.

I also made a small video showing the app work with AirPlay.
