This week I was a speaker and attendee at 360|iDev in Denver. It was my third
time at a 360|iDev (fourth if you count last year's Mini in Greenville, SC) and
I think this was probably the best one I've been to yet. Now, I'm not saying the
previous visits to this conference were bad or anything, I just enjoyed it a lot
this year. Here I'll review the week and my session.

## The Conference

I still have a hard time talking to people in these types of environments, but I
still feel it was a great time. John has done a great job keeping things
different and the same. Lunches were actually really great this year too,
especially Tuesday's Food Truck Rodeo. The keynote presentations this year were
also really great from [Josh Michael's](https://twitter.com/joshjet) talk on
being Indie to [Mike Lee's](https://twitter.com/bmf) talk on “Planetary
Engineering”. I've actually seen many of Mike's talks all the way back to 2010's
NSConference in Atlanta. This year's was so good I had to spend time in my
hotel room just thinking about it. “Don't be Evil by Accident” was just one of the
great lines in this talk.

Here are the regular sessions I went to with a brief thought on each.

### Sunday

__[Universal Layout Workshop](http://360idev.com/sessions/universal-layout-workshop/)__

This was a hands-on session about universal layout (of course) and covered a lot
of the basics. What was really great was getting the time to really play with
UIStackView. He's provided the [workshop materials on
Github](https://github.com/sammyd/360UniversalLayoutWorkshop).


__[Prototyping with Facebook's Origami](http://360idev.com/sessions/prototyping-with-facebooks-origami/)__

Another hands-on session, also with [workshop materials on
Github](https://github.com/jonfriskics/360iDev2015), where I could work with
something I hadn't had the time to play with yet. This one gave me the chance to
spend some time with Quartz Composer and Facebook's Origami. We are doing a lot
of prototyping at work now so this was actually pretty fun to play with. I've
done a few things with Quartz Composer but had not yet played with Origami. The
session provided a lot of examples to work with and it's worth looking at the
Github repo. 

### Monday

__[Stop Saying No: How I went from Fired to Indie to over 1 Million in Revenue in Under a Year](http://360idev.com/sessions/300-stop-saying-no-how-i-went-from-fired-to-indie-to-over-1m-in-revenue-in-under-a-year/)__

In this talk, Brandon Trebitowski talked about how he went from, as the title
says, being fired to having a successful client services company,
http://www.pixegon.com. It was pretty fun to hear a lot of the similar revelations we had 
at Two Toasters. I guess it's good to hear that these experiences are common!

__[Jedi Management from Far Far Away](http://360idev.com/sessions/jedi-management-from-far-far-away/)__ 

This talk about managing remote teams was really good and also really relevant for managing any team. I really wish I had seen this 
talk a couple years ago, it would have saved me some time in learning things the hard way. [Slides are available here.](https://www.icloud.com/keynote/AwBUCAESEK8yafsGgeISXNTPQLMKVcEaKaV0QSudXkMU8ISlidyxcwriWN_GiCIYVd61dBFL969oQHLPn93ja5hTMCUCAQEEIAYQ_rOqWOU4sxi2ziT-fz4qE3LOxBczMBNuoyqXrosf#Pappas_8_16_2)

__[Build a Business, not an App](http://360idev.com/sessions/100-build-a-business-not-an-app/)__

One of the common themes this week was that the idea of being an Indie developer
isn't as dead as it seems. The real problem is that it was too easy to look at
the successes and assume that we'd all be that lucky. The real problem was that
developers looked at it as building an app, not building a successful business.

__[Making a living in and out of the App Store](http://360idev.com/sessions/100-making-a-living-in-and-out-of-the-app-store/)__

Just like the last session, this was another that really pushed home the idea of
running an independent business. You just have to work at it. It was cool to
also see one half of the [Release Notes](http://releasenotes.tv) podcast give a
talk. It was almost like listening to the show.

__[Developer Horror Stories: What to do when a Product Fails](http://360idev.com/sessions/200-developer-horror-stories-what-to-do-when-a-product-fails/)__

This ended up being a panel with several of the other speakers talking about
their experiences in failing. Hearing other people talk about their horror
stories is always interesting. I thought a lot about my own stories.

### Tuesday

__[Why Being a Best Seller Can Matter More than Being a Best Developer](http://360idev.com/sessions/200-why-being-a-best-seller-can-matter-more-than-being-a-best-developer/)__

This was a great talk by Jonathan Rhyne. He went into a lot of his experiences
working with PSPDFKit and how he's worked to improve their sales. A lot of
really interesting information. 

__[Welcome to the Team!](http://360idev.com/sessions/welcome-to-the-team/)__

Adam talked about a lot of the things that help teams work quickly with each
other. He covered a lot of agile methodologies and other things that make teams,
especially those that work in an open office, better and faster.

__[The Challenges of Building a Database API (with Swift)](http://360idev.com/sessions/300-the-challenges-of-building-a-database-api-in-swift/)__

Oddly this was the only technical talk I ended up attending during the
conference. It was actually pretty interesting hearing how
[Realm](https://realm.io) built their Swift API wrapper around the Objective-C.
It was pretty fascinating to hear the difficulties they experienced but also the
how clean they made the API given these difficulties.

### Wednesday

__[Succeeding Slowly: A Practical Guide to Going Indie](http://360idev.com/sessions/300-succeeding-slowly-a-practical-guide-to-going-indie/)__

This might have been my favorite regular session of the whole conference. On the
one hand it was cool to hear a talk by the other half of [Release
Notes](http://releasenotes.tv). On the other, it was great to see practical
steps to someday going indie. As I said above the entire conference had an, I
assume, unofficial theme about how indie business aren't dead. Charles had a
great guide on how to attempt to go indie. I've already read mostly through the
book he recommended, _[Start Small, Stay
Small](http://www.amazon.com/Start-Small-Stay-Developers-Launching/dp/0615373968
)_. The [slides are available here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2maqo00l58on7b9/Succeeding%20Slowly%20360iDev.pdf?dl=0).

## My Talk

I decided, at the last minute, to propose a talk on my experiences leading a team of 
developers at Two Toasters (and continuing at Ticketmaster). Only about 20 people were there 
but I had some really good questions and a few people seemed to enjoy it. It's actually 
the first time I've given a talk that was not about a technical topic (except for one talk 
about Bad Movies) and I was a bit nervous. Anyway, you can see the slides below for my 
session titled, “How to Lose an iOS Developer in 10 Days”.
