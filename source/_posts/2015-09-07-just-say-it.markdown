During a recent interview with [Marcus Zarra on the CocoaConf Podcast][1],
Marcus made a quick little comment that really resonated with me. 

<!-- more -->

To paraphrase, Marcus said something like <span class="yellow-highlight">“If you
ask for opinions about something to a room of developers, you don't get much of
a response. If you just say something wrong they'll tell you about it.”</span>
It's an interesting point. People do love to correct you when you say something
wrong or even something not 100% correct. Maybe it's a good way to think about
speaking in public or blogging here. I'm not saying I'd want to blog without
actually researching what I write, but if I miss something maybe that's okay.

Maybe this means my decision not to have comments here was a bad idea. So, I
think I'll try having comments again. I think Marcus is right here. What do you
think?
