I’m generally not a _case type_ person. I try to find the smallest case possible for my iPhone. Still, I wanted something that protected my iPad when tossed in my bag. Generally a fan of the Moleskine, the [Dodocase]("http://www.dodocase.com/") was the top of my list. So how is it? I like it, and it actually makes me want to carry the iPad around more.

## The Good

The overall feel is wonderful. It really does lead me to carry it more. It just feels good. I haven’t had the issue I’ve seen on youtube where the iPad easily falls out. I can see how it is possible as the corner foam really is all that is holding it in.

Opening the front cover shows the Ex Libris label.﻿ Can’t quite decide if I want to put my name in there or not. Maybe this is a spot for one of my many Apple stickers.

## The not-so-good

While I don’t regret the dodocase, there are a few things that bug me. First up, the promo photos seem to show a different fabric on the outside of the case. The fabric on my case seem much more smooth and less of the texture that sold me on the case.﻿﻿

Second, the binding feels week. I am a little fearful that it will wear down over time.﻿

If you want one, you’ll be waiting. We ordered this one in early June and it just now arrived. Now priced $59, it is a bit more than other cases. Knowing it is handmade helps make it feel worth it. Overall, I’m happy with it.﻿﻿
