[Episode 61 of iDeveloper podcast](http://ideveloper.tv/podcast/ideveloperlive.html) has guest star [Danny Greg](http://twitter.com/dannygreg) from [Github](http://github.com). Aside from reavealing he didn't know who [James Earl Jones](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000469/) was, he discussed how Github gets work done.

He mentioned that their whole environment is built on being asynchronous. Meaning that everything is driven off of web-based communications and no meetings. They also have no deadlines, and focus on shipping. They ship like crazy. The Mac app is shipped several times a week and the web app is deployed much much more.

My take away was that I really want to get our continuous integration server up and running. Maybe even attempt to use [hubot](http://hubot.github.com) like Github does. Being able to say `hubot deploy [project]` seems pretty awesome. I don't know how to implement an async environment when doing client work, so I think focusing on automating as much as possible is a good start.
