Writing a programming language is not something I'd ever attempt to accomplish. However, the idea of getting a better understanding of LLVM is very interesting. This tutorial isn't a complete lesson in the compiler, but I think it will at least help you learn a little more about it..

Sounds fun. I'm in.
