Post about using github contributions to challenge myself to commit more and contribute to open source software. Sometimes I fail and have to fall back to my blog which is an open source repo. This has the added benefit of me keeping my blog more active.

Working on open source software is really fun. It allows for a lot of practice and learning from other developers. I've often been afraid of putting my code out there but at some point I decided to not care about that.
